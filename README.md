This is a dating site I'm making for religious zionists. I started this half as a joke have to master web development with Grav CMS. The site is called SettlersOnly which is kind of an inside joke.

So far I created the following custom features beyond the default grav

- added an ajax button to the user list to 'accept' new signups (instead of having to open the edit page of each user
- when one user is interested in another they can click on the button on the bottom of their profile which sends an email to them saying "userx@email.com is interested in you" (instead of users having their contact info displayed to everyone on their profile)
